# Nashville SC Data Project (Fall 2020 Remote Internship)


This was my submission for a data project which I had to complete as a part of the Fall 2020 Remote Internship selection process at Nashville SC. I had used data analysis and data visualisation to find three target players for recruitment from inside the MLS under a specified guaranteed compensation value. This also required making decisions such as which team to take charge of and which position to strengthen.
